# US-State-Game

The ** US State Game** is a fun and interactive Python script that utilizes the Turtle graphics library to create a game where players can guess U.S. states by their names and mark them on a map. The game aims to help players learn the names and locations of the 50 U.S. states in an engaging way.

##Dependencies

The US State Game project relies on the following Python packages:

1. turtle: Used for creating graphics and interactive elements in the game.

2. pandas: Used to read and manipulate data from the "50_states.csv" file.

Make sure you have these packages installed before running the game.

## How to Play

1. The game displays an image of the U.S. map with the outlines of the states.
2. You are prompted to guess the names of the U.S. states.
3. Type the name of a state and press Enter.
4. If your guess is correct, the name of the state will be displayed at its location on the map.
5. Repeat the process for other states.
6. To exit the game and save your progress, type "Exit" as your guess.

When you decide to exit the game, the remaining states that you haven't guessed will be saved to a "remaining_states.csv" file.
